#c++

a simple header file for sorting an array (type: selection sort) in C++.
to use these functions you must insert this header file in a single project or insert it in the standard library of your compiler. (if you put both the source file and the header file in a single folder, it must be included in the compiler [#include "selection_sort.h "].
if you put it in your compiler's standard library you will have to include this file in this way [#include <selection_sort.h>]).
